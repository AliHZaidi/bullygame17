Player has happiness level
Certain tasks change happiness level:
Tasks that increase happiness:
	Eating food (minimal)
	Posting online
		To post online: player interacts with computer
		When interacting with computer:
			You can:
			post online
			play a video game
			do homework
	Playing video games
	
Tasks that decrease happiness:
	Mean comments on online posts
	Mean private messages online
	doing homework
	getting yelled at by parent for not doing homework
	etc

When you reach 0 happiness:

You turn into the bully
Your happiness score is replaced with a score called "void"
You are told you will win when the void is filled (void = 100)
Each time you bully/write a mean comment/mean message, your void score++
When you reach 99 void score, your score no longer increases
Once you reach 99, writing nice comments/apologizing becomes available
By doing this option, the void will fill and you win the game
